# Newsletter-Signup-API-Practice
A newsletter signup that uses the Mailchimp API.
This page will allow the user to input their name and e-mail address which will then be sent over to MailChimp for us take hold of that data.
This is a small full stack project which uses  NodeJS and ExpressJS as backend, along with third party APIs.  
This is the first project I deployed on Heroku. 

I did this project as part of my studies with Angela Yu's "Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp"
